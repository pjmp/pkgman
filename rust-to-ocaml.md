Certainly! Here's an example of how you can call a Rust function from an OCaml project using Dune:

1. Write your Rust code:

Create a file named `lib.rs` with the following content:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

2. Build the Rust code:

Using Cargo, run the following command to build the Rust code as a static library:

```shell
cargo build --release --lib
```

3. Create an OCaml interface:

Create a file named `bindings.mli` with the following content:

```ocaml
external add : int -> int -> int = "add"
```

4. Update your Dune configuration:

In your `dune` file, add the following lines to specify the Rust library:

```dune
(library
 (name myrustlib)
 (public_name myrustlib)
 (libraries myrustlib)
 (flags (:standard -cflags -I/usr/include/rust))
 (modules myrustlib))
```

5. Link Rust with OCaml:

In your OCaml source code, you can use the Rust function by including the following line:

```ocaml
external add : int -> int -> int = "add" [@@noalloc]
```

6. Build your OCaml project:

Run the following command to build your OCaml project using Dune:

```shell
dune build
```

7. Call Rust functions from OCaml:

You can now use the Rust function `add` as if it were a native OCaml function. Here's an example OCaml code:

```ocaml
let result = Myrustlib.add 2 3 in
print_int result;
print_newline ()
```

This code calls the Rust function `add` with arguments `2` and `3`, stores the result in `result`, and then prints it.

Make sure to adjust the file paths and names according to your project structure. Also, ensure that the Rust library is accessible to the OCaml build process by providing the correct path or linking flags in your Dune configuration.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and the actual implementation may vary depending on your specific project requirements and structure.
